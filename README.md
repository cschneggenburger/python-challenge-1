# python-challenge-1

This is the repo for week 2's challenge. 

Inside of this repo is the menu.py where the program is housed.
The starter file menu.py was provided with the Module 2 Challenge files.
The starter file had code for printing the menu to the customer already. 

The code allows for a customer to input their order and quantity of each item. 
Then, the code will output the customers receipt with total price of order.
